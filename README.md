This is a project based on the Dexforce robot. The purpose of designing the interface is to simplify the operation difficulty during secondary development of the robot. The functions that can be achieved by the current initial version of the code are already introduced in the code description. 
You can modify the UI through Qt Designer and then replace modules-ui_main_new.py, or directly modify the modules-ui_main_new.py file to update the code.
